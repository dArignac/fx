# My shell configs

## ZSH
* install zsh `sudo apt install zsh`
* install oh-my-zsh `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
* change shell to zsh `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
* clone repo to `$HOME/.fx` or symlink
* run `$HOME/.fx/zsh/install.sh`

## KeePass
* copy the contents of `KeePass.config.xml` into the proper section of `$HOME/.config/KeePass/KeePass.config.xml`
* if the file does not yet exist, create and save a custom password rule in KeePass and exit the program, then the file will be there
